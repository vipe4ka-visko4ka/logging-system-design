1. I would use sentry for capturing and sending errors. Sentry gives more context data and provides more structured error stack trace.
2. Api gateway takes request from frontend and push request to message broker queue. Message broker should store messages and remove them only on acknowledgement. In this way we are sure that if something will crash, the log will be not lost. Microservice subscribe for message broker queue and write received logs to stderr or stdout based on log type.
3. I like ELK stack because of full-search which is really useful feature, but ELK costs a lot. Another attractive options is CloudWatch because of it's simplicity and AWS integrations, but it grows dramatically with large log volumes. My choice would be Grafana. Grafana doesn't cost too much with huge log volumes, comparing with other solutions. So my choice is grafana because it's cost-effective and at the same type powerful logs dashboard.
4. As we will use AWS Grafana, we can use AWS SES for emails sending. AWS Grafana has integration with SES.
5. As DevOps solution i would choose AWS management for Grafana. The main reason because in this case grafana fully managed by cloud. Scaling, deployment, mataining and security will be done by cloud rather then our devops team. One more reason is AWS integration. Nowdays most application runned in cloud and having integration with cloud is big plus.

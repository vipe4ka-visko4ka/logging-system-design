## 1. Client SDK
I would use Sentry for capturing and sending errors. Sentry provides richer context data and a well-structured error stack trace, which makes debugging much more efficient.

## 2. API Backend
The **API Gateway** will receive requests from the frontend and push them into a **message broker queue**. The message broker should persist messages until they are acknowledged, ensuring no logs are lost in case of a crash. Microservice responsible for logging subscribes to the message broker queue and store new logs.

## Dashboard
As i have experience working with **ELK**, **CloudWatch**, and **Grafana**, so my choice will be based on this background:
- The **ELK stack** provides powerful full-text search capabilities, but it expensive.
- **AWS CloudWatch** is simple and integrates well with AWS, but costs increase significantly with large log volumes. Also it's nit flexible and don't provide custom visualization options.
- My preferred choice is **Grafana**, as it is both cost-effective and powerful, offering robust dashboards without the high cost. It has great query capabilities and superior visualization features.

## 4. Email alerts
As we will use Amazon solution for ** Grafana**, we can leverage **AWS SES (Simple Email Service)** for email notifications. SES scalable and at the same time cost-effective. Also SES will be placed on the same AWS network, that increase transfering speed and enhanced security.

## 5. DevOps
For DevOps, I would select AWS management for Grafana. Grafana will be fully managed by AWS, covering scaling, deployment, maintenance, and security. This reduces operational overhead for the DevOps team. It also gives us integration with AWS services. It's a strong advantage, especially since most modern applications run in the cloud.

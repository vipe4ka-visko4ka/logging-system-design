## 1. Client SDK
I would use Sentry for capturing and sending errors. Sentry provides richer context data and a well-structured error stack trace, which makes debugging much more efficient.

## 2. API Backend
The **API Gateway** will receive requests from the frontend and push them into a **message broker queue**. The message broker should persist messages until they are acknowledged, ensuring no logs are lost in case of a crash. Microservice responsible for logging subscribes to the message broker queue and store new logs.

## Dashboard
As i have experience working with **ELK**, **CloudWatch**, and **Grafana**, so my choice will be based on this background:
| Feature         | ELK | Grafana | CloudWatch |
| --------------- |:-------------:|:--------------:| :-------------:|
| Search engine   |  Full-text search | Powerfule querying  | Simple query syntax |
| Visualization   | Customization and advanced features | Customization and advanced features | Basic graphs and lack of customization |
| Cost Efficiency | Expensive even without huge logs volumes | Cost-effective on big logs volumes | Cheap on small logs volumes, but become expensive with extensive usage |

If supposed logs volume aren't huge and we don't need dashboard customization and advanced queries i would choose CloudWatch. In other case i would select between ELK and Grafana. Both have good visualization features. Grafana is much more cost-effective, but elastic has better search capabilities. My preference is Grafana because of cost-effectiveness on huge logs volumes. 

## 4. Email alerts
As we will use Amazon solution for ** Grafana**, we can leverage **AWS SES (Simple Email Service)** for email notifications. SES scalable and at the same time cost-effective. Also SES will be placed on the same AWS network, that increase transfering speed and enhanced security.

## 5. DevOps
For DevOps, I would select AWS management for Grafana. Grafana will be fully managed by AWS, covering scaling, deployment, maintenance, and security. This reduces operational overhead for the DevOps team. It also gives us integration with AWS services. It's a strong advantage, especially since most modern applications run in the cloud.
